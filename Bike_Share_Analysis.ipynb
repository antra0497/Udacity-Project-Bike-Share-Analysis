    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."

    "## Posing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: By doing an analysis on the data we can effectively conclude following:\n",
    "            1.) We can analyse the various trend in customer like:Which are the frequent stations?,who are regular user type?etc\n",
    "            2.) We can divide and analyse data according to weekdays and weekend to find out which days have more customers?\n",
    "            3.) Analysis of data on gender basis to attract more female riders.\n",

    "> **Tip**: If you double click on this cell, you will see the text change so that all of the formatting is removed. This allows you to edit this block of text. This block of text is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options using a plain-text syntax.

    "Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. **However, you do not need to download the data yourself.** The data has already been collected for you in the `/data/` folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the `/data/` folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells above by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift** + **Enter** or **Shift** + **Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. `In [*]:`. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. `In [1]`. If there is output, it will show up as `Out [1]:`, with an appropriate number to match the \"In\" number."

When you set up a `DictReader` object, the first row of the data file is normally interpreted as column names. Every other row in the data file will use those column names as keys, as a dictionary is generated for each row.\n",

    "This will be useful since we can refer to quantities by an easily-understandable label instead of just a numeric index. For example, if we have a trip stored in the variable `row`, then we would rather get the trip duration from `row['duration']` instead of `row[0]`.\n",

    "It should also be observable from the above printout that each city provides different information. Even where the information is the same, the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration easier to work with.\n",

    "- **Duration**: This has been given to us in seconds (New York, Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.\n",
    "- **Month**, **Hour**, **Day of Week**: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",
    "- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n",

    "If you followed the use of the `.hist()` and `.show()` functions exactly like in the example, you're probably looking at a plot that's completely unexpected. The plot consists of one extremely tall bar on the left, maybe a very short second bar, and a whole lot of empty space in the center and right. Take a look at the duration values on the x-axis. This suggests that there are some highly infrequent outliers in the data. Instead of reprocessing the data, you will use additional parameters with the `.hist()` function to limit the range of data that is plotted. Documentation for the function can be found [[here]](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html#matplotlib.pyplot.hist).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**: Use the parameters of the `.hist()` function to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution? How would you describe the shape of each distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "For Subscribers: the peak value lies between the interval 5 - 10. \n",
    "For Customers: the peak value lies between the interval 15 - 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both the graph are dense on one side therefore they are Right Skewed Distribution. "

    "## Performing Your Own Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've performed an initial exploration into the data available. You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?\n",
    "- Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?\n",
    "- During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html). In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The [documentation page for `.bar()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar) includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6**: Continue the investigation by exploring another question that could be answered by the data available. Document the question you want to explore below. Your investigation should involve at least two variables and should compare at least two groups. You should also use at least one visualization as part of your explorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "The give data can be use to understand customer behaviour for  increasing service efficiency: the most commom comparison that can be made is customer behaviour on weekends and weekdays.I will be exloping more on this through visulaization\n",
    "\n",
    "For Customer: Ridership was greater on Weekends as compared to Weekdays. Maximum ridership was on Saturday\n",
    "For Subscriber: Ridership was greater on Weekdays as compared to Weekends. Maximum ridership was on Wednesday"

    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7**: Putting the bike share data aside, think of a topic or field of interest where you would like to be able to apply the techniques of data science. What would you like to be able to learn from your chosen subject?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "\n",
    "We have tremendous amout of raw data in our surrounding, it all depends on how we use it. For now I have interest to know more about maintaining and optimising searcg results. yes definenately I will try as much as I can to learn more about data science and big data concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: If we want to share the results of our analysis with others, we aren't limited to giving them a copy of the jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. We can also export the Notebook output in a form that can be opened even for those without Python installed. From the **File** menu in the upper left, go to the **Download as** submenu. You can then choose a different format that can be viewed more generally, such as HTML (.html) or\n",
    "PDF (.pdf). You may need additional packages or software to perform these exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you are working on this project via the Project Notebook page in the classroom, you can also submit this project directly from the workspace. **Before you do that**, you should save an HTML copy of the completed project to the workspace by running the code cell below. If it worked correctly, the output code should be a 0, and if you click on the jupyter icon in the upper left, you should see your .html document in the workspace directory.
